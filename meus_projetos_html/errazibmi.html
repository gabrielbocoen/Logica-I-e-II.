I gave my best
you noticed?
you recognized?
yea?
you forgot my birthday
you only look for me when you need help
you copy all my schoolworks
are you happy?
do you think I'm happy?
no?
why?
you said I'm a mess
after this I tidied my room
I'm not afraid of death
are you?
yea?
well
you spoke
I listened
you forgot
I remember every day
drop this cigarette
look in my face
I'm your friend only when it favors you
you are toxic
I'm not your friend
but I don't hate you
you made me feel
something I had never felt
and now?
maybe I have sin
late to lamentation
I'm not afraid of death
you had?
hope not
<br>
you forgot my birthday again
